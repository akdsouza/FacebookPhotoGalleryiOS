OVERVIEW

Facebook has a neat photo gallery in their mobile app.

If you havenâ€™t seen it, when you tap a photo you get a modal dialog and you can swipe images back and forth as well as pinch to zoom. Replicating this effect is a much larger pain than one might anticipate, especially in the world of AutoLayout where a misplaced constraint can ruin the whole thing.

Here is a working implementation, feel free to use it for your own purposes. It also handles device rotations gracefully.
Uses a scroll view with an image. Should work on both iPhone and iPad.

SETUP AND INSTALL

Should just work after you grab it and open the workspace. Requires MKNetworkKet (included).
