OVERVIEW

This is a demonstration of how to implement an image view inside a scroll view in iOS 7 + AutoLayout. You can pinch to zoom, scroll left and right. The photos will also respond correctly to device rotations. The goal is to show  a working implementation of a nested scrollview / imageview combo. 

SETUP AND INSTALL

Should just work after you grab it and open the workspace. Requires MKNetworkKet (included).
